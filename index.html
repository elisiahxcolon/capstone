    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>

    <p>
        The backend component of our network-security capstone project merges a simulated router and a neural
        network-based anomaly detection model to create intelligence for our project. By synthesizing the data
        produced by the simulated router on several aspects of network device activity—open ports, latency,
        response consistency, traffic load, and device types—we avoid scanning real networks and instead generate
        controlled test cases for development. This simulated data is processed through a feature-extraction
        pipeline and converted into numerical vectors suitable for machine-learning models. A TensorFlow/Keras
        neural network has been trained on these vectors to identify normal, risky, or harmful network configurations.

        After training, the model can analyze newly generated simulated router data and produce an anomaly score
        along with a classification of whether the router is behaving normally. The anomaly score helps determine
        device risk, while the classification guides the scanner toward identifying up-to-date security threats.
        This component provides an authentic testing environment and a smart anomaly-detection capability.

        Currently, this tool is only for educational and exploratory use and does not connect directly to the
        scanner. It demonstrates how network attributes become machine-learning features and how a neural network
        learns to classify simulated network configurations. This prototype system introduces students to data
        preprocessing, supervised learning, anomaly detection, and the connection between configuration and
        security risk. As it expands, it will support deeper cybersecurity learning and the development of
        intelligent computational tools.

    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Web-Based Network Information Tool</strong><br>
        This project was developed as part of a broader hands-on networking and systems
        research environment. Alongside the web application, a dedicated
        <strong>Windows Server 2025</strong> instance was deployed on a separate laptop
        to simulate a realistic enterprise setup. The server was fully configured with
        <strong>Active Directory Domain Services</strong>, <strong>DNS</strong>, and
        <strong>DHCP scopes</strong> to support domain operations and provide a controlled
        platform for testing how client devices obtain and report network configuration details.
        The intention was to create a structured environment for studying fundamental network
        behaviors and designing a lightweight, web-based information tool.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Front-End (Client-Side)</strong></p>
    <p>
        The front end is built with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. The interface collects:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The user's full name.</li>
        <li>A brief explanation of why the tool is being used.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        After input validation, the browser sends a structured JSON request to the backend:
    </p>
    <pre><code>POST http://localhost:3000/scan-self
{
    "fullName": "...",
    "reason": "..."
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        Once the response is received, the interface displays key network information from the
        local machine, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>IPv4 address</li>
        <li>Default gateway</li>
        <li>DNS server assignment</li>
        <li>MAC address</li>
        <li>DHCP configuration status</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Back-End (Server-Side)</strong></p>
    <p>
        The backend is implemented using <strong>Node.js</strong> with the <strong>Express</strong> framework.
        It processes incoming requests, executes controlled system-level commands, and returns
        parsed network information to the browser. All activity is logged to maintain clarity,
        traceability, and responsible usage.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><code>express</code> — provides routing and static file delivery.</li>
        <li><code>cors</code> — manages browser communication.</li>
        <li><code>child_process.exec</code> — retrieves local network details through system commands.</li>
        <li><code>fs</code> — stores detailed request logs in <code>logs.json</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><code>POST /scan-self</code></strong></p>
    <p>
        This endpoint ensures all fields are present, processes the system output, extracts
        relevant values, and logs a complete entry in the audit file:
    </p>

    <pre><code>{
    fullName: "...",
    reason: "...",
    timestamp: "...",
    networkDetails: {
        ipv4: "...",
        gateway: "...",
        dns: "...",
        mac: "...",
        dhcp: "..."
    }
}</code></pre>

    <p>
        These logs create a clear, maintainable record of usage while ensuring all operations
        stay fully local and do not interact with or scan external systems.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Educational & Research Value</strong></p>
    <p>
        The combination of a configured Windows Server 2025 environment and this browser-based
        tool provided a structured platform for exploring how clients receive network assignments,
        how directory services behave, and how system-level networking data can be safely
        extracted and visualized. The goal was to design a small-scale prototype inspired by
        real administrative tools—focusing on clarity, accountability, and controlled behavior.

    <h4>Former Implementation</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Network Scanner Overview</strong><br><br>

        <strong>Development & Environment:</strong><br>
        The <em>Network Scanner (NS)</em> was developed entirely in <strong>Python</strong> and tested on a <strong>home router</strong> to simulate real-world network environments.<br>
        A simple <strong>PyGame interface</strong> was used to provide a graphical UI for displaying network information.<br>
        The implementation was functional but limited in versatility, focusing mainly on local discovery and basic scanning capabilities.<br><br>

        <strong>Core Functionalities:</strong><br>
        - <code>get_public_ip()</code> – Retrieves the public IP address.<br>
        - <code>get_local_ip()</code> – Detects the local IP assigned by the router.<br>
        - <code>scan_ports(ip, ports)</code> – Scans ports and reports open/closed status.<br>
        - <code>arp_scan_fallback()</code> – Uses the ARP table to detect local devices.<br>
        - <code>measure_download_speed()</code> – Estimates download speed.<br><br>

        <strong>Tools & Libraries:</strong><br>
        Written and tested in <strong>PyCharm</strong> using <code>socket</code>, <code>subprocess</code>, and <code>requests</code>.<br>
        These provided lightweight alternatives to tools like <strong>Nmap</strong> and <strong>Wireshark</strong>.<br><br>

        <strong>Future Goals:</strong><br>
        - Move UI from PyGame to web.<br>
        - Increase compatibility and integrate stronger APIs.<br><br>
