  <h3>Implementation</h3>

  <p>
    <strong>Network Scanner (NS)</strong><br>
    The Network Scanner currently meets the original proposed functionality. It:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discovers the requesting device's hostname and local IP address.</li>
    <li>Scans open and closed ports on a target IP.</li>
    <li>Discovers devices on the local network (ARP-based fallback).</li>
    <li>Measures and reports current ping and approximate download speed.</li>
    <li>Provides a simple Pygame-based interface for visualization and interaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The NS was developed in Python using PyCharm. While the original goal included integrating tools such as Nmap and Wireshark, those tools were not fully integrated due to time and compatibility constraints. Instead, the implementation relies on standard and third-party Python libraries for network queries and measurements, for example:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>requests</li>
    <li>socket</li>
    <li>subprocess</li>
    <li>urllib.request</li>
    <li>os, sys</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key NS functions</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>get_public_ip()</code> — retrieves public IP via the ipify API.</li>
    <li><code>get_local_ip()</code> — retrieves the machine's local IP assigned by the router.</li>
    <li><code>get_isp(ip)</code> — looks up ISP information (e.g., via ipinfo.io).</li>
    <li><code>scan_ports(ip, ports, timeout=0.3)</code> — checks a list of ports and reports open/closed status.</li>
    <li><code>arp_scan_fallback()</code> — uses the system ARP table to discover local devices (IP + MAC).</li>
    <li><code>measure_download_speed()</code> and <code>draw_speed_meter(speed)</code> — measure download throughput and display a Pygame speed meter.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Simulated Router (SR) &amp; Anomaly Detection</strong><br>
    The Simulated Router creates a dynamic, testable network and integrates with a simple anomaly detection system. It generates devices with randomized IPs and port configurations and exposes that data to the NS for evaluation.
  </p>

  <p><strong>SR &amp; ML components</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>SimulatedRouter.generate_devices(num_devices)</code> — generates devices with IPs and random open-port sets.</li>
    <li><code>SimulatedRouter.expose_data_for_scanner()</code> — returns device configuration data in a structured format for the scanner.</li>
    <li><code>AnomalyDetector.prepare_features(devices)</code> — converts devices to numerical feature vectors (e.g., last IP octet, number of open ports).</li>
    <li><code>AnomalyDetector.train_and_detect(devices)</code> — uses K‑Means clustering to find outliers; smallest clusters are flagged as anomalous.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Example: if policy expects ≤ 3 open ports per device, a device with 10+ open ports will likely be clustered as an outlier and flagged for review.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Planned improvements / future work</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement a web-based front end instead of Pygame for richer UI and easier sharing.</li>
    <li>Integrate tools like Nmap and Wireshark by running them inside controlled virtual machines or isolated environments.</li>
    <li>Use virtual machines to safely test private-network behaviors and legality-sensitive experiments (e.g., simulated DDOS testing).</li>
    <li>Expand SR realism: add hostname, simulated OS fingerprints, richer metadata, and policy-driven configuration rules (banned ports, whitelists).</li>
    <li>Build a hybrid detection engine: ML clustering + rule-based policy engine for stronger anomaly detection.</li>
    <li>Expose a REST API so the Network Scanner can query simulated networks dynamically.</li>
    <li>Visualize detection output in real time on a web dashboard and add more advanced traffic simulation (Scapy) where appropriate.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The long-term goal is to evolve this into a lightweight intrusion-detection / simulation environment that balances practical tooling with safe, repeatable testing workflows.

    <h4>Former Implementation</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Network Scanner Overview</strong><br><br>

        <strong>Development & Environment:</strong><br>
        The <em>Network Scanner (NS)</em> was developed entirely in <strong>Python</strong> and tested on a <strong>home router</strong> to simulate real-world network environments.<br>
        A simple <strong>PyGame interface</strong> was used to provide a graphical UI for displaying network information.<br>
        The implementation was functional but limited in versatility, focusing mainly on local discovery and basic scanning capabilities.<br><br>

        <strong>Core Functionalities:</strong><br>
        - <code>get_public_ip()</code> – Retrieves the public IP address of the machine using the ipify API.<br>
        - <code>get_local_ip()</code> – Detects the local IP assigned by the router.<br>
        - <code>scan_ports(ip, ports)</code> – Scans specified ports on a device and reports open or closed status.<br>
        - <code>arp_scan_fallback()</code> – Uses the system’s ARP table to detect local network devices.<br>
        - <code>measure_download_speed()</code> – Estimates download speed by transferring sample data.<br><br>

        <strong>Tools & Libraries:</strong><br>
        All code was written and tested in the <strong>PyCharm IDE</strong> using imported Python libraries such as 
        <code>socket</code>, <code>subprocess</code>, and <code>requests</code>.<br>
        These tools worked as lightweight substitutes for heavier network tools like 
        <strong>Nmap</strong> or <strong>Wireshark</strong>, which were planned but not fully integrated.<br><br>

        <strong>Future Goals:</strong><br>
        - Transition the UI from <strong>PyGame</strong> to a <strong>web-based front end</strong> for more flexibility and scalability.<br>
        - Improve cross-compatibility and integrate more advanced APIs for real-time network monitoring.<br><br>

    <h5>Network Familiarity</h5>
    <p>
        <strong>Windows Server:</strong> A server operating system developed by Microsoft that manages network resources, users, and security. It provides the environment to test and experiment with the Network Scanner and simulate client-server interactions.<br><br>

        <strong>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):</strong> A network protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network. It ensures devices, including virtual machines, receive IP addresses dynamically, which the Network Scanner can detect and analyze.<br><br>

        <strong>DHCP Scope:</strong> A range of IP addresses that a DHCP server can assign to devices. This allows controlled IP distribution across the network.<br><br>

        <strong>IP Address:</strong> A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. IP addresses allow devices to communicate with each other and are essential for the Network Scanner to locate devices.<br><br>

        <strong>ISO:</strong> A disk image format used to distribute operating systems. The Windows Server ISO will be used to deploy the server in a virtual machine (VMware) for testing.<br><br>

        <strong>Firewall:</strong> A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It ensures only authorized traffic is allowed, helping to simulate a secure environment for the Network Scanner.<br><br>

        <strong>Relevance to the Project:</strong> This setup allows safe experimentation with the Network Scanner, understanding IP assignments, device detection, and client-server relationships, all within a controlled virtual environment.
